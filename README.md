# Dijkstra Algorithm & Floyd-Warshall Algorithm Research Project

This was for a research project I did for my Data Structures class.

I was given the prompt of researching this topic by writing a paper that discusses the history, purpose, efficacy, usage, and comparing it to other algorithms and their derivatives. I also had to develop programs to supplement the paper, and give a presentation.
